# Function to calculate the sum of numbers in a list
def sum_of_numbers(numbers):
    # Initialize a variable 'total' to store the sum, starting from 0
    total = 0
    
    # Loop through each number in the provided list
    for number in numbers:
        # Add the current number to the total
        total += number
    
    # Return the final sum after the loop finishes
    return total

# Example usage of the function:
numbers_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # List of numbers to be summed
result = sum_of_numbers(numbers_list)  # Call the function with the list
print(f"The sum is: {result}")  # Output the result of the sum
